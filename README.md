# EEG-Based AI and LLM Interactions on Human Cultural Communication Behavior

## Overview

This repository hosts the research and implementation resources for the study on the **Impact of EEG-Based AI and LLM Interactions on Human Cultural Communication Behavior**. The project explores how brain-computer interfaces (BCI), artificial intelligence (AI), and large language models (LLMs) influence cultural communication dynamics. 

Our approach introduces two key frameworks:

1. **Cultural Interaction Dynamics Network (CIDN)** - A graph-based and probabilistic model designed to capture linguistic, semantic, and pragmatic norms within different cultural contexts.
2. **Adaptive Cultural Alignment Strategy (ACAS)** - A dynamic adaptation mechanism that refines message alignment in real-time by embedding cultural contexts into latent spaces.

## Research Goals

- Enhance cross-cultural communication by integrating EEG-based AI with LLMs.
- Develop advanced probabilistic modeling to address cultural variability in message encoding and decoding.
- Improve interpretability and accuracy of AI-driven cultural communication systems.
- Contribute to the fields of BCI, HMI, and Industry 4.0 technologies.

## Methodology

- **EEG Signal Processing**: Leveraging neural activity data to enhance AI understanding of cultural communication patterns.
- **Graph-Based Modeling**: Using CIDN to analyze and represent cultural norms in linguistic interactions.
- **Probabilistic Adaptation**: Applying ACAS to ensure real-time message alignment with cultural contexts.
- **Experimental Validation**: Evaluating system performance based on message interpretation accuracy, cultural compatibility, and communication efficiency.
